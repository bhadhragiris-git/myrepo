- Terraform Version Manager is used to manage different types of Terraform versions
- first we need to install tfenv as it is not downloaded with terraform install
- tfenv allows you install different versions of terraform i.e. 1.2.3, 1.2.5
- if suppose terraform version 1.2.3 is not being used we can switch to the latest version of terraform.
- tfenv use 1.2.6
- tfenv --help can be used to see different options. /h2>
